Each year, the Center hosts approximately 20 international academic and artistic programs, ranging from one to four weeks in duration. These programs focus on cutting-edge topics in fundamental science and avant-garde artistic creation, encouraging deep interdisciplinary exploration. Participation is by invitation only, and selected participants may request financial support for travel and accommodation.

Scholars, artists, and institutions interested in proposing or attending a future program should submit an application including:
•	A brief statement of interest and background
•	Proposed topic or area of contribution
•	Preferred time frame and duration
•	Whether financial assistance is requested
Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis. Due to limited space, early submission is encouraged.
