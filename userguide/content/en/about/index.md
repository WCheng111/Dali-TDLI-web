The Dali Center for Science & Art is dedicated to creating a platform where the rigor of science meets the creativity of art.
We believe that both scientific exploration and artistic expression are driven by the same human forces‚Äîcuriosity and imagination. Whether it‚Äôs cutting-edge theoretical physics or avant-garde artistic experiments, they can find resonance here.
Founded by scientists, artists, and cultural advocates, the Center operates under the principle of ‚Äúby creators, for creators‚Äù, maintaining a lean and efficient administrative structure to support the freest and most open exchange of ideas.
